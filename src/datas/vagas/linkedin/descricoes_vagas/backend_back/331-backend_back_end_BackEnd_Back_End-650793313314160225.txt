Sobre a vaga
About usRadiant Security is the maker of the industry's first AI SOC Analyst, which uses Gen AI to emulate the experience, processes, and decision-making of top-tier security analysts. With Radiant, alerts are sent to our AI analyst before they go to the SOC. Each alert is subjected to dozens to hundreds of dynamically selected tests used to determine maliciousness. Within 3 minutes decision-ready results are available that include a detailed incident summary, root cause analysis, and an incident specific response plan. This means, by the time an analyst sees an incident they know if it was real, what happened, what caused it, and have a plan to fix it. After reviewing the report, analysts can respond manually using AI generated, step-by-step instructions on how to respond to this incident, using single-click responses which run over API connections to take corrective actions, or with fully automated response that runs without human intervention. With Radiant, SOC teams detect more attacks, respond more rapidly, and get more done.This is a hybrid position and we are attending the offices 3 times a week. We have offices in Pleasanton, California and São Paulo, Brazil.ResponsibilitiesWork in a highly collaborative team of great people. i.e., design whiteboard sessions, daily stand-ups, code review, shared demosDrive the development of important components in our productResearch and adopt state-of-the-art technologyWork closely with data scientists and security researchersMentor junior engineersQualificationAdvanced EnglishYou have experience with scalable architectures/technologies such as K8S, FaaS, Apache Kafka, BigDataYou have 6+ years of experienceYou are proficient in Javascript (Node.js)You are a T-shape person - you're pro in one area but can collaboratively jam in other areas if neededYou enjoy solving problems togetherYou're a builder - you enjoy building production-grade software from the ground upYou're not afraid of new technology/language - it's great that you know what you know, but it's more critical for us that you can learn new stuff that might fit better and implement itPreferredExperience with AWS LambdaExperience with working on ML/AI projects and collaborating with data scientistDesirablePythonExperience in the cybersecurity spaceSalary rangeUSD 7.000 - USD 10.000 monthlyStock optionsBenefits:Health Insurance (Safety Wing)Stay Healthy subsidy (for gym and sports)Unlimited PTO (enjoy the holidays of your location)Parental leave
