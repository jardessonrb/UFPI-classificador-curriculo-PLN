Luckily, most people have an underutilized washer/dryer, which when combined with our Laundry Pro app, provides the first-ever manual labor work-from-home gig in the world. For all our users, we're a marketplace for a better life.Our ProgressPerfect product market fit drove a 100x surge in users & revenue and double-digit MoM growth over the past few years.

Your feedback will shape how we approach quality from day one.Keep the Wheels Turning: Integrate your automated tests with our CI/CD pipeline so we can deliver fast without sacrificing an ounce of quality.See Beyond Bugs: We don’t just want someone to find issues—we want someone who anticipates problems before they even become problems. Root because analysis is your superpower.Make Us Faster, Smarter: Continuously improve our testing processes, finding new ways to automate, streamline, and ensure quality at speed.Protect the past: Perform regression testing and validate fixes for reported issues.Track defects: Identify, document, and track defects using a defect tracking tool.Please Note: This is a venture startup opportunity with the expectation of giving your best to it. There will be equity and there will be long hours, a lot of energy spent towards delivering fast, and the work / life balance will be leaning more towards work.What’s in it for youLearn and evolve your skills using the latest and greatest technology tools in a rapidly growing company.Learn from the best people around you.
